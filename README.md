# Water Level Detector Using Arduino Nano
## 1. Introduction
The water level detector project aims to design a system using Arduino Nano to monitor and detect the water level in a container. This system can find applications in various fields, including agriculture, home automation, and industrial automation. The project involves using sensors to measure the water level and providing visual or audible alerts when the water level reaches a specific threshold.
## 2. Components Used
->Arduino Nano

->Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)

->Breadboard and Jumper Wires

->LED (for visual indication)

->Buzzer (for audible alert)

->Power Source (USB cable or external power supply)

->Water Container (to demonstrate the system)
## 3. Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance between the sensor and the water surface. As the water level rises or falls, the distance detected by the sensor changes accordingly. The Arduino Nano reads this distance data and compares it with a predefined threshold to determine the water level. When the water level crosses the threshold, the system triggers alerts through LEDs and a buzzer.
## 4. Circuit Connection
->Connect the VCC and GND pins of the ultrasonic sensor to the corresponding pins on Arduino Nano.

->Connect the Trigger and Echo pins of the ultrasonic sensor to digital pins on Arduino Nano.

->Connect the positive leg of the LED and the anode of the buzzer to digital pins on Arduino Nano.

->Connect the negative leg of the LED and the cathode of the buzzer to GND pin on Arduino Nano.
## 5. Conclusion
The water level detector using Arduino Nano demonstrates a practical application of sensor interfacing and basic programming concepts. By measuring water levels and providing alerts, this system can be utilized in various real-world scenarios. The project enhances understanding of ultrasonic sensors, Arduino programming, and electronic circuits, making it an educational and practical endeavor.
